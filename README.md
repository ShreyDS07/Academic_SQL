# SQL Assignment: Data Analysis and Querying

## Overview
This project showcases SQL queries developed for a data analysis assignment. The objective was to analyze transactional data to extract insights useful for business decision-making. The project highlights advanced SQL skills, including filtering, aggregations, and table joins.

## Objectives
1. Identify the month with the highest transactional value in 2021.
2. Determine the category with the highest transaction value in 2022.
3. Compare transaction values across categories between 2021 and 2022 to identify trends.
4. Analyze the top 5 most popular payment methods used in 2022.
5. Rank specified products based on their transaction values.

## Key Insights
- **Highest Transactional Month (2021)**: June 2021 recorded the highest transactional value.
- **Highest Transactional Category (2022)**: Electronics generated the highest transaction value in 2022.
